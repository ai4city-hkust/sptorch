Description: The implementation of various neural network-based geospatial analysis 
             methods is supported based on the torch framework, including but not 
             limited to geographical neural network weighted regression, spatiotemporal 
             geographical neural network weighted regression, geographical neural network 
             weighted logistic regression, and spatial interpolation of neural network 
             ensembles.
